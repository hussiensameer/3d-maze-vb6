                               3DMaze -- Maze Game

                              Version 1.2 (11/25/95)


     Generate and solve mazes under Windows 95.

     The mazes are displayed in three dimensions.

     Select "Action" on the menu bar to get a "New" maze, "Solve" a maze, or
"Clear" the solution from the maze.

     Except for minimizing and restoring the 3DMaze window, resizing the window
results in a new maze.  Larger windows yield mazes with more rooms.

     Select "Style" on the menu bar to pick "Square rooms" or "Hexagonal
rooms".

     The scroll bar can be used to change the tilt of the maze.

     After a maze with square rooms is drawn, you can use the arrow keys to
solve it.  After a maze with hexagonal rooms is drawn, you can use the Home,
Up Arrow, PgUp, End, Down Arrow, and PgDn keys to solve it.  If those keys
are layed out on your numeric keypad as follows:

                             Home   Up Arrow   PgUp

                             End   Down Arrow  PgDn

the direction of movement in the window will correspond to the direction of 
the key from "5" on the keypad.  Note that the up and down arrows revert to
controlling the scroll bar after a maze is solved.

     Each maze has exactly one solution that does not involve backtracking
(passing through a doorway more than once).
